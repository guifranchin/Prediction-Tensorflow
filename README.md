# Prediction Tensorflow

The Prediction Tensorflow project is aimed at learning how to create and train a machine learning model using Tensorflow. This project uses a dataset of input and label data in a CSV file, which is read and processed using the fs and csv modules. The data is then used to train a machine learning model with different combinations of hyperparameters, such as number of layers and number of units in each layer. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and binary crossentropy loss function, and its accuracy is evaluated on a validation dataset.
